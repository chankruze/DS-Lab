## Terms

1. **Interface**: Interface represents the set of operations that a data structure supports. An interface only provides the list of supported operations, type of parameters they can accept and return type of these operations.

1. **Implementation**: Implementation provides the internal representation of a data structure. Implementation also provides the definition of the algorithms used in the operations of the data structure.

## Characteristics

1. **Correctness**: Data structure implementation should implement its interface correctly.
1. **Time Complexity**: Running time or the execution time of operations of data structure must be as small as possible.
1. **Space Complexity**: Memory usage of a data structure operation should be as little as possible.

## Execution Time Cases

1. **Worst Case**: This is the scenario where a particular data structure operation takes maximum time it can take. If an operation's worst case time is `ƒ(n)` then this operation will not take more than `ƒ(n)` time where `ƒ(n)` represents function of `n`.

1. **Average Case**: This is the scenario depicting the average execution time of an operation of a data structure. If an operation takes `ƒ(n)` time in execution, then `m` operations will take `mƒ(n)` time.

1. **Best Case**: This is the scenario depicting the least possible execution time of an operation of a data structure. If an operation takes `ƒ(n)` time in execution, then the actual operation may take time as the random number which would be maximum as `ƒ(n)`.

## Basic Terminology

1. **Data**: Data are values or set of values.
1. **Data Item**: Data item refers to single unit of values.
1. **Group Items**: Data items that are divided into sub items are called as Group Items.
1. **Elementary Items**: Data items that cannot be divided are called as Elementary Items.
1. **Attribute and Entity**: An entity is that which contains certain attributes or properties, which may be assigned values.
1. **Entity Set**: Entities of similar attributes form an entity set.
1. **Field**: Field is a single elementary unit of information representing an attribute of an entity.
1. **Record**: Record is a collection of field values of a given entity.
1. **File**: File is a collection of records of the entities in a given entity set.
