## Definitions

1. A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.

1. In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.

1. Data Structures are the programmatic way of storing data so that data can be used efficiently.

## Why ?

To become more efficient in:

1. Data search
1. Multiple requests
1. Processing speed

>Data structures and algorithms (DSA) goes through solutions to standard problems in detail and gives you an insight into how efficient it is to use each one of them. It also teaches you the science of evaluating the efficiency of an algorithm. This enables you to choose the best of various choices. (Programiz)

## Applications

Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output. Algorithms are generally created independent of underlying languages

From the data structure point of view, following are some important categories of algorithms:

1. **Search**: Algo to search an item in a DS.
1. **Sort**: Algo to sort items in a certain order in a DS.
1. **Insert**: Algo to insert item in a DS.
1. **Update**: Algo to update an existing item in a DS.
1. **Delete**: Algo to delete an existing item from a DS.

## Prerequisites
A basic understanding of `C` or `C++` programming language, any IDE or TextEditor, compilation of source files and execution of binaries.
